I am a current PhD student at The University of Sydney. I work within the Centre for Complex Systems. I am particularly interested in multi-agent systems, applied machine learning, spatial modelling and computational economics. Previously, I completed my BSc and MSc in Computer Science (Machine Learning) at at Victoria University of Wellington.

Some of my publications are included below. For most recent list, please visit my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yfrOml0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Generally, I try and make all my research open access, either via releasing a Preprint, providing source code, or using open-access journals when possible. If any research is not available, feel free to contact me directly and I will be happy to provide a copy or source code.
